# WAFv2 regional web ACL in front of the ALB.
#   1. AWS managed rule groups for common, known-bad inputs (including Log4j),
#      IP reputation and SQLi. Managed rules are preferred over hand-written
#      signatures because AWS maintains them as new CVEs appear.
#   2. A per-IP rate limit that blocks abusive clients before they reach the app.
